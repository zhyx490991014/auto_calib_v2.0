# GStreamer-SEI

A video streaming tool based on GStreamer that injects custom SEI NAL units into H.264/H.265 bitstreams, which can be used to transmit CARLA simulation timestamps.

Couldn't find a suitable tutorial, so I wrote it from scratch...

## Environment

It is recommended to use the pip version of the GStreamer bundle:

```bash
pip install gstreamer-bundle opencv-python numpy pyyaml
```

If you need to run `demo.py --carla` or `carla_camera.py`, you also need to install the corresponding version of the CARLA Python package.

Or use the official installer (Windows):

- [GStreamer MSVC x86_64](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/) install runtime + devel
- Automatically sets the `GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64` environment variable during installation
- `pip install pygobject pycairo`

## Quick Start

```python
from gst_streaming import GStreamerConfig, GStreamerObject

cfg = GStreamerConfig()
cfg.vcodec = "auto"  # auto-detect nvh265enc, fallback to x265enc
cfg.output_mode = "rtsp_server"  # or "rtsp" to push to MediaMTX
cfg.output_host = "0.0.0.0"
cfg.output_port = 8554
cfg.rtsp_mount = "/stream/cam_front_left"
cfg.output_url = "rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/stream/cam_front_left"

gst = GStreamerObject(cfg)
gst.initialize_pipe()

# Push BGRA frames
gst.send_frame_in_bytes(bgra_bytes)

gst.destroy_pipe()
```

See `demo.py` for a complete example.

## Running the Demo

`demo.py` supports two modes:

```bash
python demo.py --video
python demo.py --carla
```

By default, the `--video` mode reads:

```text
D:\Navigation\Code\gst\test.mp4
```

By default, it starts a built-in RTSP Server listening on:

```text
rtsp://0.0.0.0:8554/stream/cam_front_left
```

Test pull commands:

```bash
ffplay -fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -framedrop rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/stream/cam_front_left
```

or:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/stream/cam_front_left latency=0 drop-on-latency=true buffer-mode=3 ! rtph265depay ! h265parse ! nvh265dec ! d3d11videosink sync=false
```

If you want to switch back to pushing to [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx), change the output mode in `demo.py` / `GStreamerConfig` to:

```python
cfg.output_mode = "rtsp"
cfg.output_url = "rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/stream/cam_front_left"
```

And start MediaMTX first.

## Attaching Cameras to Existing CARLA Vehicles

`carla_camera.py` connects to an existing CARLA world, finds existing vehicles, and attaches one or more cameras to the vehicle for RTSP streaming. It does not create vehicles, set `fixed_delta_seconds`, or call `world.tick()`. It is suitable for scenarios where another host program is responsible for vehicle control and simulation advancement.

By default, it reads `config.yaml` in the current directory:

```bash
python carla_camera.py
```

You can also explicitly specify the configuration:

```bash
python carla_camera.py --config config.yaml
```

Vehicle lookup configuration example:

```yaml
vehicle:
  label: Car_001
  model: vehicle.lincoln.mkz_2020
  role_name: car
```

`role_name` is the recommended matching field. If multiple vehicles in the same world match, please specify `actor_id` in the config. `label` is mainly for readability; CARLA actors may not have this attribute by default.

Camera configuration example:

```yaml
cameras:
  - enable: true
    sensor_type: sensor.camera.rgb
    role_name: car_001_camera_rgb_front_left
    location: { x: 3.0, y: -2.1, z: 1.9 }
    rotation: { pitch: -38.0, yaw: -90.0, roll: 0.0 }
    image_size_x: 1920
    image_size_y: 1080
    sensor_tick: 0.1
    stream:
      mount: /stream/cam_front_left
      label: gst-front-left
```

`sensor_tick` is the camera sampling interval, not the world tick. For multiple cameras, simply append entries in the `cameras` array. The RTSP server reuses the same port and outputs multiple streams through different mounts.

## PyInstaller Packaging

The repo provides `demo.spec` for packaging `demo.py` into a single-file exe:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm demo.spec
```

`carla_camera.py` corresponds to `carla_camera.spec`:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm carla_camera.spec
```

`carla_camera.spec` does not bundle `config.yaml` into the exe. At runtime, place `carla_camera.exe` and `config.yaml` in the same directory, or launch the exe from a directory containing `config.yaml`. This spec outputs the exe to the current directory instead of the default `dist` directory.

`gst_streaming.py` runs before `import gi`:

```python
import gstreamer_libs
gstreamer_libs.setup_python_environment()
```

This restores the runtime environment of `pip install gstreamer-bundle` in frozen programs. `demo.spec` also collects the following GStreamer wheel packages:

- `gstreamer_libs`
- `gstreamer_plugins`
- `gstreamer_plugins_libs`
- `gstreamer_plugins_restricted`
- `gstreamer_plugins_gpl`
- `gstreamer_plugins_gpl_restricted`
- `gstreamer_python`
- `gstreamer_ext_runtime`

On machines without an NVIDIA GPU, GStreamer plugin scanning or hardware encoder detection may produce D3D11 / MediaFoundation-related warnings. If you need stable operation on GPU-less machines, it is recommended to further trim unnecessary hardware-related plugins in the spec, or fix `vcodec` to the software encoder `x265enc`.

## Streaming Modes

| Mode | Description | Test Status |
|---|---|---|
| `udp` | RTP over UDP, connectionless low latency | AI wrote it, I haven't tested |
| `tcp` | RTP over TCP, reliable transmission | Same |
| `srt` | SRT protocol, low latency & reliable, suitable for public networks | Same |
| `rtsp` | Push to RTSP servers like MediaMTX using `rtspclientsink` | Tested |
| `rtsp_server` | Current process starts `gst-rtsp-server`, clients pull directly | Tested |

## SEI Format

```
Start code:    00 00 00 01
NAL header:    4E 01     (H.265 PREFIX_SEI, type=39)
              / 06         (H.264 SEI, type=6)
payloadType:   C8         (200, custom)
payloadSize:   09
payload:       3B + 8 bytes big-endian uint64 UTC microsecond timestamp
```

The sender injects SEI after the parser's src pad. If `vcodec="auto"` is used, the code saves the actual selected encoder to avoid accidentally injecting an H.264 SEI header into an H.265 stream.

## Windows Log Notes

When using `gstreamer-bundle`'s `gst-launch-1.0` to pull streams, you may see something like:

```text
giolibproxy.dll: The specified module could not be found
Failed to load module ... giolibproxy.dll
```

This is usually a GIO proxy module dependency warning and generally does not affect local RTSP pulling.

## Decoder Side (C++)

Reference implementation for parsing SEI and extracting timestamps from a parser sink pad probe:

```cpp
void parseSei(GstBuffer* buffer)
{
    if (mCodec != "h264" && mCodec != "h265")
        return;

    GstMapInfo map;
    if (!gst_buffer_map(buffer, &map, GST_MAP_READ))
        return;

    const uint8_t* data = map.data;
    size_t size = map.size;
    const size_t headSize = 4 + (mCodec == "h264" ? 1 : 2);

    for (size_t i = 0; i + headSize + 1 + 1 + 9 <= size; ++i) {
        // Search for start code: 00 00 00 01
        if (data[i] != 0x00 || data[i + 1] != 0x00 ||
            data[i + 2] != 0x00 || data[i + 3] != 0x01)
            continue;

        // NAL type: H.264 type=6, H.265 type=39/40
        int nalType;
        if (mCodec == "h265") {
            nalType = (data[i + 4] >> 1) & 0x3F;
            if (nalType != 39 && nalType != 40) continue;
        } else {
            nalType = data[i + 4] & 0x1F;
            if (nalType != 6) continue;
        }

        // payloadType 200 (0xC8)
        if (data[i + headSize] != 0xC8) break;
        uint8_t payloadSize = data[i + headSize + 1];
        if (payloadSize != 9) break;

        // EBSP -> RBSP: skip emulation prevention bytes (00 00 03)
        const uint8_t* src = &data[i + headSize + 2];
        uint8_t cleanPayload[64];
        size_t maxSrcLen = size - (i + headSize + 2);
        size_t si = 0, di = 0;
        while (si < maxSrcLen && di < payloadSize) {
            if (si + 3 < maxSrcLen &&
                src[si] == 0x00 && src[si + 1] == 0x00 &&
                src[si + 2] == 0x03 && src[si + 3] <= 0x03) {
                cleanPayload[di++] = src[si++];
                cleanPayload[di++] = src[si++];
                si++;  // skip 0x03
            } else {
                cleanPayload[di++] = src[si++];
            }
        }

        if (di < 9 || cleanPayload[0] != ';') break;

        // 8 bytes big-endian uint64 UTC us -> ns
        uint64_t utcUs = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; ++j)
            utcUs = (utcUs << 8) | cleanPayload[1 + j];
        uint64_t utcNs = utcUs * 1000;

        // Store by PTS
        uint64_t pts = GST_BUFFER_PTS(buffer);
        {
            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mSeiMutex);
            mPtsToSeiData[pts] = { utcNs };
        }
        break;  // Only take the first SEI per frame
    }

    gst_buffer_unmap(buffer, &map);
}
```

# auto_calib_v2.0

## Modifications

Modifications were made to `lidar2camera/auto_calib_v2.0` from [PJLab-ADG/SensorsCalibration](https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/SensorsCalibration).

Since execution on Jetson was too slow with only a single CPU core being utilized, OMP was used to optimize various for-loops to fully load the CPU. Point cloud segmentation was not optimized because it is iterative.

Since the point cloud used is merged from multiple files, there may be duplicate points, so downsampling was applied. However, voxel filtering overflows when the point cloud is too large, so octree was used instead, computing the centroid for each leaf node.

Support for left-multiplying extrinsic parameters by deltaT was added in `BruteForceSearch` and `RandomSearch`, because it feels like the search should be performed on the point cloud transformed to the camera coordinate system before projection? Not sure... it probably has no practical impact.

Added BruteForceSearch for translation in `Calibrate()`.

---

## Testing

The final extrinsic parameters' translation is not very accurate, differing from ground truth by ten to twenty centimeters, while the angles are not far off.

The projection also has minor imperfections, but it is roughly aligned.

The final score differs from ground truth by a very small margin, around 0.00x, yet this is enough to cause the search to deviate from the ground truth. It seems projection is less sensitive to translation than rotation?

Testing was conducted in CARLA, so the intensity of LiDAR points is inaccurate and only related to distance. Tried removing intensity weight from the score, but the results were not satisfactory either.
